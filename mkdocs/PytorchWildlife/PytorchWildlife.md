# PytorchWildlife Module

The `PytorchWildlife` module is a core component of this repository, designed to facilitate wildlife detection and classification tasks using PyTorch. It provides utilities for data processing, model implementation, and post-processing.

## Overview

The module is structured into the following submodules:

- **`data`**: Contains utilities for handling datasets and applying transformations.
- **`models`**: Includes implementations for classification and detection models.
- **`utils`**: Provides miscellaneous utilities for post-processing and other tasks.

## Submodules

### `data`
- `datasets.py`: Defines dataset classes for loading and preprocessing data.
- `transforms.py`: Implements data augmentation and transformation utilities.

### `models`
- `classification/`: Contains classification model architectures.
- `detection/`: Includes detection model architectures.

### `utils`
- `misc.py`: Provides helper functions for miscellaneous tasks.
- `post_process.py`: Implements post-processing utilities for model outputs.

## Getting Started

To use the `PytorchWildlife` module, import the required submodules as follows:

```python
from PytorchWildlife.data import datasets, transforms
from PytorchWildlife.models import classification, detection
from PytorchWildlife.utils import misc, post_process
```

Refer to the specific submodule documentation for detailed usage instructions.
