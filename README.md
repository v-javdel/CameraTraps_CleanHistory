## 🐾 Introduction

At the core of our mission is the desire to create a harmonious space where conservation scientists from all over the globe can unite. Where they're able to share, grow, use datasets and deep learning architectures for wildlife conservation.
We've been inspired by the potential and capabilities of Megadetector, and we deeply value its contributions to the community. As we forge ahead with Pytorch-Wildlife, under which Megadetector now resides, please know that we remain committed to supporting, maintaining, and developing Megadetector, ensuring its continued relevance, expansion, and utility.

Pytorch-Wildlife is pip installable:
```
pip install PytorchWildlife
```

To use the newest version of MegaDetector with all the existing functionalities, you can use our [Hugging Face interface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ai-for-good-lab/pytorch-wildlife) or simply load the model with **Pytorch-Wildlife**. The weights will be automatically downloaded:
```python
from PytorchWildlife.models import detection as pw_detection
detection_model = pw_detection.MegaDetectorV6()
```

For those interested in accessing the previous MegaDetector repository, which utilizes the same `MegaDetectorV5` model weights and was primarily developed by Dan Morris during his time at Microsoft, please visit the [archive](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/archive) directory, or you can visit this [forked repository](https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector/tree/main) that Dan Morris is actively maintaining.

## 📣 Announcements

### Pytorch-Wildlife Version 1.2.1

#### SpeciesNet is available in Pytorch-Wildlife for testing! 
- We have added SpeciesNet into our model zoo, which is compatible with all detection models provided by Pytorch-Wildlife. Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/SppNet_TF/PytorchWildlife/models/classification/speciesnet_base/sppnet_readme.md) for more details!

#### Deepfaune in Our Model Zoo!! 
- We are excited to announce the release of the Deepfaune models—both the detector and classifier—in PyTorch-Wildlife, adding to our growing model zoo. A huge thank you to the Deepfaune team for your support! Deepfaune is one of the most comprehensive models focused on the European ecosystem for both detection and classification. It serves as a great complement to MegaDetector, which has primarily been trained on datasets from North America, South America, and Africa. The Deepfaune detector is also our first third-party camera trap detection model integrated into PyTorch-Wildlife!
- To use the model, you just need to load them as any other Pytorch-Wildife models: 
```
detection_model = pw_detection.DeepfauneDetector(device=DEVICE)
classification_model = pw_classification.DeepfauneClassifier(device=DEVICE)
```
- You can also use the `detection_classification_pipeline_demo.py` script in the demo folder to test the whole detection + classification pipeline. 
- Please also take a look at the original [Deepfaune website](https://www.deepfaune.cnrs.fr/en/) and give them a star! 

#### Deepfaune-New-England in Our Model Zoo Too!!
- Besides the original Deepfaune mode, there is another fine-tuned Deepfaune model developed by USGS for the Northeastern NA area called Deepfaune-New-England (DFNE). It can also be loaded with `classification_model = pw_classification.DFNE(device=DEVICE)`
- Please take a look at the orignal [DFNE repo](https://code.usgs.gov/vtcfwru/deepfaune-new-england/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads) and give them a star! 

### Pytorch-Wildlife Version 1.2.0
- [What's New](ANNOUNCEMENT.md)



### :racing_car::dash::dash: MegaDetectorV6: SMALLER, FASTER, BETTER!  
We have officially released our 6th version of MegaDetector, MegaDetectorV6! In the next generation of MegaDetector, we are focusing on computational efficiency, performance, modernizing of model architectures, and licensing. We have trained multiple new models using different model architectures, including Yolo-v9, Yolo-v10, and RT-Detr for maximum user flexibility. We have a [rolling release schedule](#mag-model-zoo-and-release-schedules) for different versions of MegaDetectorV6.

>[!NOTE]
> - Following our initial release, we’ve been delighted to see so many people explore our new models. We’d like to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who has shown interest in our latest models—your support means a great deal to us!
> - That said, we’ve received a number of feedback comments highlighting a discrepancy between the reported performance (particularly MDV5) and the actual performance observed. We are actively investigating this issue and have identified a potential error or corruption in the validation data we used. For the time being, we’ll remove our current performance numbers from the model zoo for now to avoid confusion.
> - We sincerely apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. Our team is working diligently to address this matter, and we will update our experiments—and potentially retrain the model if data corruption is confirmed—as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience and understanding!



MegaDetectorV6 models are based on architectures optimized for performance and low-budget devices. For example, the MegaDetectorV6-Ultralytics-YoloV10-Compact (MDV6-yolov10-c) model only have ***2% of the parameters*** of the previous MegaDetectorV5 and still exhibits comparable animal recall on our validation datasets. 

<!-- In the following figure, we can see the Performance to Parameter metric of each released MegaDetector model. All of the V6 models, extra large or compact, have at least 50% less parameters compared to MegaDetectorV5 but with much higher animal detection performance. -->

<!-- ![image](assets/ParamPerf.png) -->

<!-- >[!TIP] -->
<!-- >From now on, we encourage our users to use MegaDetectorV6 as their default animal detection model and choose whichever model that fits the project needs. To reduce potential confusion, we have also standardized the model names into MDV6-Compact and MDV6-Extra for two model sizes using the same architecture. Learn how to use MegaDetectorV6 in our [image demo](demo/image_detection_demo_v6.ipynb) and [video demo](demo/video_detection_demo_v6.ipynb). -->


### :bangbang: Model licensing 

The **Pytorch-Wildlife** package is under MIT, however some of the models in the model zoo are not. For example, MegaDetectorV5, which is trained using the Ultralytics package, a package under AGPL-3.0, and is not for closed-source commercial uses if they are using updated 'ultralytics' packages. 

There may be a confusion because YOLOv5 was initially released before the establishment of the AGPL-3.0 license. According to the official [Ultralytics-Yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) package, it is under AGPL-3.0 now, and the maintainers have discussed how their licensing policy has evolved over time in their issues section. 

<!-- We aim to prevent any confusion or potential issues for our users. -->

<!-- > [!IMPORTANT]
> THIS IS TRUE TO ALL EXISTING MEGADETECTORV5 MODELS IN ALL EXISTING FORKS THAT ARE TRAINED USING YOLOV5, AN ULTRALYTICS-DEVELOPED MODEL. -->

We want to make Pytorch-Wildlife a platform where different models with different licenses can be hosted and want to enable different use cases. To reduce user confusions, in our [model zoo](#mag-model-zoo-and-release-schedules) section, we list all existing and planned future models in our model zoo, their corresponding license, and release schedules. 

In addition, since the **Pytorch-Wildlife** package is under MIT, all the utility functions, including data pre-/post-processing functions and model fine-tuning functions in this packages are under MIT as well.

> [!TIP]
> We are specifically reporting `Animal Recall` as our primary performance metric, even though it is not commonly used in traditional object detection studies, which typically focus on balancing overall model performance. For MegaDetector, our goal is to optimize for animal recall—in other words, minimizing false negative detections of animals or, more simply, ensuring our model misses as few animals as possible. While this may result in a higher false positive rate, we rely on downstream classification models to further filter the detected objects. We believe this approach is more practical for real-world animal monitoring scenarios.

## 👋 Welcome to Pytorch-Wildlife

**PyTorch-Wildlife** is a platform to create, modify, and share powerful AI conservation models. These models can be used for a variety of applications, including camera trap images, overhead images, underwater images, or bioacoustics. Your engagement with our work is greatly appreciated, and we eagerly await any feedback you may have.


The **Pytorch-Wildlife** library allows users to directly load the `MegaDetector` model weights for animal detection. We've fully refactored our codebase, prioritizing ease of use in model deployment and expansion. In addition to `MegaDetector`, **Pytorch-Wildlife** also accommodates a range of classification weights, such as those derived from the Amazon Rainforest dataset and the Opossum classification dataset. Explore the codebase and functionalities of **Pytorch-Wildlife** through our interactive [HuggingFace web app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AndresHdzC/pytorch-wildlife) or local [demos and notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/tree/main/demo), designed to showcase the practical applications of our enhancements at [PyTorchWildlife](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md). You can find more information in our [documentation](https://cameratraps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

👇 Here is a brief example on how to perform detection and classification on a single image using `PyTorch-wildlife`
```python
import numpy as np
from PytorchWildlife.models import detection as pw_detection
from PytorchWildlife.models import classification as pw_classification

img = np.random.randn(3, 1280, 1280)

# Detection
detection_model = pw_detection.MegaDetectorV6() # Model weights are automatically downloaded.
detection_result = detection_model.single_image_detection(img)

#Classification
classification_model = pw_classification.AI4GAmazonRainforest() # Model weights are automatically downloaded.
classification_results = classification_model.single_image_classification(img)
```
